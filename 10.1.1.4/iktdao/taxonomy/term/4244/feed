&lt;p&gt;須菩提尊者慈訓&lt;br /&gt;
  Merciful teachings of Venerable Subhuti&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎  珍惜是什麼？（班員：快樂的時光要珍惜、健康也要珍惜，家庭的愛、上天的慈悲都要珍惜。）你們都知道什麼是你們該珍惜的，是不是有去珍惜呢？你們有掌握好時間嗎？有善加的利用你的時間，還是只把你的時間花在個人身上？有為大家幫忙嗎？ (有時候)。&lt;br /&gt;
What does treasure and cherish mean? (Class reply: To cherish the happy moments, family love, and God’s mercy.) Since you all know what to cherish, then do you really do it? Do you manage your time well? Do you utilize your time very well or just spent the time on personal affair? Do you help people? (Class reply: Sometimes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎  如果你是一位菩薩在世的活佛，你用你的終生奉獻給眾生，從古至今每一位成大事業的活佛，都是把一生奉獻給眾生。如果你有一顆菩薩之心，你將會很樂意奉獻自己。今天前面的善知識們，他們願意學習做菩薩，因為他們離開家鄉，離開家人，就是為了救渡印度的眾生。&lt;br /&gt;
Every and each one of the Living Buddhas since the ancient to now contributed his whole life to sentient beings; if you are a current living Bodhisattva, you spend your whole life devoting to the human beings. You will be very happy to devote yourself when you have the heart of Bodhisattva. Today, these people in the front are learning to be a Bodhisattva since they are away from home and the family, so as to help and rescue the sentient beings in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎  印度有那麼好的因緣，因為佛陀慈悲，佛陀當初在此一帶宏揚佛法，而你們皆是佛緣深厚，才能夠坐在這裡聽聞佛法。今天所傳的佛法跟佛陀當初所傳的佛法是一樣的，不同之處皆是現在的修道人非常幸福，因為有一批前面的人在犧牲奉獻，讓你們走非常平坦之路。當初佛陀為了求此佛法，花費了非常多的時間，就是為了研究超生了死，涅盤之法，而今天眾善知識們卻是佛法來找你們。&lt;br /&gt;
India has such a wonderful karma it is due to Buddha’s preaching Dharma in this area and all of you have deep affinity with Buddha so that you can sit here listening to the preaching of Buddha’s. The Tao preaching and the Dharma in today is the same as Buddha’s time, the only difference is that the Tao cultivators nowadays are very blissful and blessed, because there are a good numbers of seniors sacrificing and devoting themselves so that you can walk on the even path. Buddha spent lots of time searching for this Tao/ Dharma in order to realize the way to transcend life and death and reach the nirvana. While in today, Tao comes here to find you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎  濟公活佛非常慈悲，能夠擔起三曹重任，在座的眾善知識們，可要好好體會，更要好好珍惜。你們能夠坐在這裡，皆是前世與佛陀緣份深厚，根基不凡，才能得到佛法的滋潤，所以才能來這裡。&lt;br /&gt;
Ji-Gong Living Buddha is so merciful to shoulder the holy mission for the Three World’s salvation, all of you should do the best to understand, to cherish and treasure this. Today you can sit here it is due to your deep spiritual foundation and good karma with Buddha to be able to showered in the teaching of Buddha’s teaching and the Dharma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎  把時間忘記，把心安在這裡，這樣你才有收穫。如果你人在這裡，心卻不在這裡，這樣坐了一天卻無所收穫，這樣太浪費自己的時間，也太浪費前面眾善知識的時間。當初我們修行，是二十四小時都在佛陀身旁，從不覺得厭倦，只希望天天跟佛陀在一起，多聽聽佛陀宣揚佛法，才能夠提高我們的心境，對我們證道才有幫助。&lt;br /&gt;
Forget the time and rest your hearts here so that you can have a harvest. You will get nothing even though your physical body is here, because your mind is not here. Thus, you waste your time and also the time of the people in the front. Originally when we were cultivating, we stayed with Buddha all the time and never got tired, we just wished to be with Buddha and listening more of Buddha’s teaching so that our mind level could be upgraded which was very helpful to our enlightenment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎  今天眾善知識站在前面，跟大家宣揚佛法，並非簡單的事，希望坐著的善知識們，能夠抱著很虔誠的心，來接受他們。不知道你們接不接受他們，不知道你們歡不歡迎他們？（YES）既然接受他們也歡迎他們，就要拿出你們的那顆心，讓他們也感覺得到你們在歡迎他們。如果你們保持沈默沒有行為上的表示，那他們將會很失望，他們也許不會再來，這樣對你們沒有好處。&lt;br /&gt;
Today these people are standing in front of you to propagating Tao, this is not something easy; wishing you who are sitting on the chairs to be able to accept them. Do you accept and welcome them? (Class reply: Yes.)Since you have accepted them then please show your heart to let them feel that you welcome them. If you keep quiet without true action, they will be very disappointed and maybe they will not come again which does not do you any good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎  所以希望你們大家拿出你們的真心，來研究、來學習，修道、辦道是沒有時間、空間限制，無論你們在那裡，當下都可以聽道理、修道，把道帶在自己身上。不要忘了，只要你是菩薩，承認是菩薩，道就在你身上。&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore, hope you will show your true heart to study and learn, there is no limit on Tao cultivation and propagation; wherever you are, you can listen to the teaching and cultivate Tao, bring Tao with you. Do not forget that so long as you are and recognize yourself as a Bodhisattva, Tao is with you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎  當初佛陀在宣揚佛法的時候，為我們所有的弟子，都因材施教，因為我們每一位眾生，領悟都不一樣，吸收的能力也不同。在渡化不同的眾生，也用不同的方法。當你在思考不同的方法，上天將會加智慧在你身上。所以眾善知識們，要突破、要用心、要去走，才會有所收穫。&lt;br /&gt;
When Buddha was preaching the Truth/ Dharma, he used different ways and materials to guide all the disciples, because, every sentient being has different ability of realization and absorption. Use different ways when giving preaching to different people. God will add wisdom to you when you are thinking the ways to teaching people. Therefore all of you need to breakthrough, to be attentive, to practice so that you will get harvest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎  當初佛陀也是這樣在教化我們，我們去接觸眾生，從眾生身上，我們才能學習更多，才能夠發覺個人的優點，在從個人的專長，優點當中，再加深去修行，那就是在走屬於你們自己的路。&lt;br /&gt;
At that time, Buddha was teaching us in this way. We went to have contacts with sentient beings and we learned more from them. We also found individual’s good points then reinforce our cultivation and that is to walk on the way that belongs to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎  濟公活佛慈悲，讓我們得受這珍貴的一指點。請問眾善知識們，你們得到什麼，你們不是說在這裡求道、得道嗎？那你們得到了什麼？（瞭解人生超生了死的路）&lt;br /&gt;
Ji-Gong Living Buddha is so merciful to let us receive the precious Tao. Then what have you got? Didn’t you say that you already received Tao in the Temple? What have you got? (Class reply: To realize life and the way to transcend life and death.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎ 宣揚佛法，有不同的使命，你們的使命非常重大。當初我們在宣揚佛法，所走的地方，非常有限，而今天佛法卻是遍佈全世界。&lt;br /&gt;
There are different kinds of missions to propagate the Truth and your missions are so enormous. Back to the time when we were preaching the Truth, there were very limited areas that we could go; and now, Tao/ the Truth prevails in the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;濟公活佛慈訓&lt;br /&gt;
 Merciful Teachings of Ji-Gong-Huo-Fo (Ji-Gong Living Buddha)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   眾生都有慈悲心，為什麼有些人會去做壞事，他們沒有慈悲心嗎？他們也有慈悲心啊！只是因為外面不好的氣，把他們的慈悲心給蓋著了。他們來到這個紅塵，被這個紅塵的一些惡習給感染了。因為，他們已經失去了理智，不知道什麼是好的或不好的，所以你們是幸福的一群。因為你們知道怎樣讓你的慈悲心顯現出來，怎樣去幫助別人，因為助人為快樂之本。&lt;br /&gt;
All sentient being have a merciful heart, but why do some people still do bad things? Don’t they have a merciful heart? In fact, they have a merciful heart, but it has been covered up by the bad chi (energy) from outside. They came to this dusty world and were polluted by it, then they lost their sense and sensibility, not knowing what is good and what is not good. You are lucky people, because you know how to show your merciful heart and how to help people. Helping people is the source of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   不要分等級，用你的手去幫助別人，這樣越幫助別人會越快樂。因為每個人都是父母所生，每一個人來到世間，都有他的使命，每一個人都有任務在身，要去看重自己，如果你看輕別人，人家也會看輕你。&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t be discriminating. Offer your helping hand to whoever is in need, and you yourself will benefit and feel the joy. All the human beings come from the same origin. They have their respective missions to the world. Therefore, respect yourself as well as others. If you despise people, people will despise you too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎	 團結在一起力量才大，一個人的能力有限，不管做任何事要團結一致，&lt;br /&gt;
事情一定會很成功。&lt;br /&gt;
Union is strength. If separated, people have only limited power. Whatever you do will be successful if you can work in-group and with perfect unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   誠意歡迎我，要拿出朝氣，唱歌時要大聲唱出來，問問題要懂得回答，這樣才能表現你們的誠意。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring out your energy and vitality to show your welcome. Sing out loud and answer as well. Make Holy Teacher feel your heartfelt sincerity and welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   要對自己肯定，修道也一樣，你覺得修道好嗎？（YES）來佛堂對你有沒有益處，自己最清楚，不要感覺人家勉強你來，要自願，這樣心裡比較舒服，來了也比較高興。&lt;br /&gt;
Affirm yourself and have faith in Tao cultivation. Do you feel cultivation is good? (Class reply: Yes!) Whether coming to the Temple benefits you or not, you know it better than anyone else. So don’t feel you’re forced to come. If you convince yourself you’re voluntary, you will feel much better and will be more delighted to come again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   你們來了兩天覺得如何？（YES）有好的東西在這裡，你就要趕快來，要來的比人家早。有沒有聽說人家為了要來開法會，還沒開門就開始等了，因為他怕來遲了，聽不到好的道理。來這裡行功了愿，他怕來遲了，被人家做完了。&lt;br /&gt;
How do you feel after staying two days here? (Class reply: Very good!) Good things are here and you must hurry in to get them. Have you ever heard of some people waiting outside the temple simply to attend the Tao Seminar? They do so because they are afraid that they would not be able to hear the wonderful teachings if they are late. They are afraid that they would miss the chance of doing holy affairs if they are late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   老師有沒有來遲？(經理：大汗流小汗滴)來得剛剛好，來的早不如來的巧，太早來你們都還沒到，老師本來早上10點就要來，可是沒有人，如果我慢一點來，你們都回去了。老師還要抓緊你們的時間才能來，是你們配合我，還是我配合你們？(班員：配合老師)&lt;br /&gt;
Is Holy Teacher late? (Master: Sweating all over.) Holy Teacher came at the right time. Coming early is not better than coming at the right time. In fact, Holy Teacher was scheduled to come at ten o’clock in the morning, but nobody’s here at that time. But if Holy Teacher came at later time, everybody would have already left. Therefore, Holy Teacher has to adjust His time to suit yours. Nevertheless, should you cooperate with Holy Teacher, or Holy Teacher cooperates with you? (Class reply: We should cooperate with Holy Teacher!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   他們擔心你們不來，他們很希望把道理講給你們聽。這些道理是人生必須知道的道理，他們希望你們瞭解了再去告訴別人，更希望你們的同胞瞭解人生的意義是什麼？道的尊貴是什麼？能夠讓你們知道超生了死這一條路，不用在人生這個苦海一直在輪迴，希望將來大家都能夠回去。&lt;br /&gt;
They are worried if you did not come. They all have a great message to share with you. This message is something all human beings should know about. They want you to get this message and spread it to even more people, making your fellow people in India also understand what true meaning of life is. They also want you to understand the preciousness of Tao. It can help you break your reincarnation and transcend the life and death cycle, free you from the infinite sufferings of reincarnation. Hope everybody can make it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎  你們對自己有沒有信心（YES），對自己肯定而不是看別人肯定自己。&lt;br /&gt;
Do you have faith in yourself? (Class reply: Yes!) It is you that can give your the faith; nobody can replace you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   來到這裡很熱，你們熱不熱？(不熱)為什麼不熱？(班員：因為喜悅，充滿了高興)，那為什麼老師很熱？(班員：因為老師不習慣)，老師那有可能不習慣，因為老師要到處去找有緣人，所以，老師會熱而且很心急，急的走來走去停不下來，為什麼老師會這樣？天底下有什麼事能讓仙佛著急？急天下的眾生還有很多沒救。&lt;br /&gt;
It is hot in here. Do you feel hot? (Class reply: No.) Why not? (Class reply: Because of joy!) Then why does Holy Teacher feel hot? (Class reply: Because Hoy Teacher is not used to the weather here.) How can it be possible? Holy Teacher feels hot because He is hurrying to save people. You can see Holy Teacher walking here and there and never seem to stop His steps. The only thing that can hurry and worry the Buddhas is that, there are still so many sentient beings that still remain unsaved.&lt;br /&gt;
◎   印度國家有多少人？（10億人口）找一個有緣人不容易，要找一個願意來這裡的人更不容易。現在時間也很緊急，但在人間的眾生都認為不寶貴，仙佛卻是每分每秒要把握，所以仙佛一來總希望你們珍惜時間，把握現有的光陰。要來人間走一趟容易，但是人生過得有意義有價值就不容易了。&lt;br /&gt;
What is the population of India? (Class reply: More than one billion.) It is difficult to find somebody having affinity with Buddhas, and even more difficult is it to make him/her come to the Temple. Not much time is left, so saints and Buddhas are making the most of the limited time, while human beings always waste their time. So Buddhas want you to cherish your time, because spending lifetime is easy, but living a meaningful and fruitful life is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   你們來這裏坐一天也是一天，過的有意義也是一天，希望你們多珍惜有限的時間，沒有人知道你能活多久，現在不知道下一口氣能不能吸進來，所以人生很短暫。他們跟你們講那麼多道理，就是希望你們聽懂了道理，再去告訴別人。&lt;br /&gt;
Instead of wasting one day sitting here, why don’t you be attentive learning to live a meaningful life, making today a fruitful and rewarding day in life. Life is short and unpredictable. Hope you can make the most of your limited time; nobody knows how long they can live or whether they can inhale after they exhale. These people teach you with the only hope that you can digest their teachings and share with even more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   他們也可以不用跑到這裡來，離開家庭，暫時不工作，花精神、花時間，那是為什麼？為什麼不去別的地方，來到這裡呢？是一種緣，那種緣份是累世結成的，雖然到不同的國家，不同種族、不同語言，但是這個緣份是斷不了的，累世結的緣，說好這一世要渡化你們。&lt;br /&gt;
They could have been elsewhere without having to leave behind their families, temporarily stop their professions, spend so much time and make so much effort just here for you. Then why should they come here? It is because of fate. Fate is the result accumulated over the previous lives. It can’t be broken by differences in nationality, skin color, or language. You meet because you at some point of past life have promised to come and to save each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   你們會不會覺得他們很奇怪，為什麼跑來這裡，講一大堆話。（NO ）他們講的話，你們聽的懂嗎？聽不懂要早點講，不然他們以為你們聽的懂，越講越高興。&lt;br /&gt;
Do you have any doubt why they come and keep lecturing a lot? (Class reply: No!) Do you understand what they are lecturing about? If not, ask them to clarify. If you don’t ask, they would think that you understood and would keep on saying something you actually don’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎  渡化眾生要瞭解他們的需要，先給他們聽一些他們聽得懂的道理，每次來多灌輸他們道的觀念，讓他們瞭解你們的用心。&lt;br /&gt;
Saving the sentient beings you need to serve their needs. Tell them something they can understand first, and then step by step guide them into Tao. Meanwhile, let them know you really care about them and willing to help them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   要做老師的徒弟不容易，為什麼不容易？做老師的徒弟不是來享受，是要到世界各國去渡化眾生。現值白陽期，知道什麼是白陽期？(講師：解釋白陽期的意義)&lt;br /&gt;
Being a disciple of Ji-Gong Living Buddha is not easy, and why is it not easy? Because he is not here to live a fancy life, but is to travel around the world helping and saving all sentient beings, especially now it is time of White-Sun era. Do you know the meaning of White-Sun era? (The lecturer explains the White-Sun era.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   大家共同前進，絕對不要有後退，修道這條路，本來就沒有後退，更何況現在是第三期（白陽期），也沒有機會讓你後退。白陽期是廣收有緣人的期，要把九六原胎佛子都帶回去，所以這個責任很大，你們有沒有勇氣去接受(YES），你們想不想跟著他們去，還是只想看著他們去。(跟著他們去修道、辦道)&lt;br /&gt;
Now let us proceed in unity with nobody lagging behind. In cultivating Tao everybody should advance and no one retreats. In fact, this White-Sun era allows no one to retreat, for it is time to save all sentient beings back to heaven. This is an unprecedented great mission. Do you have the courage to take on it? (Class reply: Yes!) Do you want to personally join them in this holy endeavor, or you just want to be an onlooker? (Class reply: We want to join them in cultivating and propagating Tao!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   這個大家庭不會不讓別人加入，只要你們願意進來，我們都很歡迎，但是修道不簡單。你們不要只看他們講講課，沒講課時也沒有在睡覺。那麼他們在忙些什麼？(佛事)&lt;br /&gt;
This Tao group is like a big family. You will not be rejected if you really volunteer to join in this holy endeavor. However, remember that cultivating Dao is not something that can be taken leisurely. Look at them! During the times they are not giving lecturers, they are still busy and never idle around. What are the things that keep them involved? (Class reply: Heavenly things!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   現在是天人合一，天會幫助人，人也要幫助天，因為仙佛沒有肉體，如果要仙佛顯化給你們看，你們除了看人也要看仙，那仙佛太複雜了。天人合一互相幫助，你們有肉體，可以做收圓的工作。&lt;br /&gt;
Heaven and humans help each other, both sides acting in perfect union. As Heaven helps humans, so shall humans help Heaven. Buddhas have no physical body, so they need Holy Mediums to pay you compassion and give speeches. But you have a useful physical body, with which you can do whatever you can to help complete this salvation mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   修道不簡單，除了要修自己，要把自己不好的丟掉，把好的接收過來，如果一個人太自滿，就沒有辦法把外界好的東西接收進來，所以要把自己身上不好的丟掉，再去向別人學習。&lt;br /&gt;
Cultivating Tao is not easy. You need to cultivate yourself by breaking your bad habits and evil, learning to be modest and to pursue good thoughts and deeds. Arrogance makes people too proud of themselves, so they need to be modest and rid of the bad before learning the good and righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   每一個人都是每個人的老師，因為每一個人都有優點，所以每個人都要學習別人的優點。&lt;br /&gt;
Because all humans have their unique strengths, they serve as your teachers teaching you something that is beneficial to you. But the premise is that you should willingly humble yourself and learn from their strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   這些糖果不一樣，和你在商店買的不一樣，因為拜了仙佛，吃了可以身體健康，讓嘴巴甜甜去渡化更多的眾生。&lt;br /&gt;
These sweets are different from those you purchase in the stores. They are offerings to Buddhas that can make you healthy and “sweeten” your mouth to talk people into the Temple, giving you the golden chance to save people in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   東西不會從天而降，要靠自己的本事來拿，要先有動作，才會給你，如果你自己連第一步踏出來的勇氣都沒有，就拿不到。世間每一件事情也一樣，你希望每一件事情都成功的話，必先付出，但也要看你付出的誠心到那裡，發心到那裏，上天給你的就到那裏。你付出百分之百，上天就給你百分之百，如果你只付出百分之五十，你也只能得到百分之五十。&lt;br /&gt;
There is no free lunch. You need to make efforts before you get what you want. If you don’t even have the courage to make the first step, how can you reach the destination? It is the same with all the jobs you do. If you want to succeed, you need to put in your effort and concentration to what you’re doing. God will reward you exactly for how much effort and truthfulness you have dedicated. If you put in 100 percent, you get 100 percent, but if you give 50 percent, you get only 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   所以要拿這些糖果，除了踏出你的第一步，伸出你的雙手，還要有一個表示，對眾生做些什麼？這些讓你有行功了愿的機會。&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore, in order to get these sweets, you need to step out, extend both your hands, and what else should you do? Do something to help the general public. This is a golden opportunity for you to accumulate your merits and fulfill holy vows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   讓你展現慈悲的那一面。把你的慈悲展現出來，因為每一個人都是善良的，只是你沒有把它展現出來，所以拿這些糖果不容易，好的東西不容易拿到。太容易拿到，你們就不會珍惜。&lt;br /&gt;
Show the merciful side of you. You are all born with mercy and sympathy; let it show. In fact, everyone has a kind heart, but not granted with the chance to show it. You may probably wonder why it is so difficult getting these sweets. Good things never come easily. When good luck just happens to you easily, you will take it for granted and would never cherish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   每個人都要珍惜為眾生做事的時候，不要怕犧牲，上天不會虧待我們每一個人，你為人人，上天一定為你。&lt;br /&gt;
You should cherish and be grateful for your being able to save the general public. Don’t be afraid of making sacrifices. God will never disappoint you. If you put in your effort and truthfulness to God, God will certainly reward you as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   告訴別人，你們在佛堂學到什麼，將學的東西與別人分享，要有慈悲心，幫助別人那你們就功德無量了。&lt;br /&gt;
Share with people what you learn here in the Temple. This sharing and unconditional merciful deed will help people and in turn will make you equally rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   他們人生地不熟，你們要幫助他們，讓他們可以將佛法宣揚給印度眾生。&lt;br /&gt;
These people from afar are unfamiliar with the culture and language here, so you must help them, help them to spread this wonderful message all over India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   不只帶人去公園運動，還要把道告訴人家，因他們求道以後不瞭解，就不會發心盡力去救渡苦難的同胞。&lt;br /&gt;
Invite people to do exercise in the park and spread Tao to them. If they don’t understand or identify with Tao, then even if they receive Tao, they do not know why they should devote their effort and truthfulness to helping their suffering fellow people in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   要學習仙佛的腳步，要發慈悲心，跟緊老師的腳步，到各地去渡化眾生。&lt;br /&gt;
Follow in Buddhas’ footsteps. Be merciful and compassionate; keep up with Holy Teacher to propagate Tao all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   人生每一天都在學習，學會法喜、謙卑，渡化貧窮的人。&lt;br /&gt;
Each moment you’re learning new things. Learn to be joyful, modest, and willing to extend your helping hand to whomever in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   人小，志氣大，要多用心，幫助需要幫助的人。&lt;br /&gt;
Though you are young in age, your ambition should be sky-high. Focus your attention in helping whoever needs you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎	 做老師的好徒弟，不容易呀？為什麼？要很忙，去渡化世界各地的眾&lt;br /&gt;
生。&lt;br /&gt;
Being a good disciple of Ji-Gong Living Buddha is not easy. Why? Because you must be involved in saving the sentient beings all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   如何改脾氣，在發脾氣時往好的方面想，不要忘記去控制脾氣。&lt;br /&gt;
How can you refine your temper? Always look on the bright side, and remember to control your temper anywhere, at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   心情開朗，身體就健康，沒有什麼事是沒有辦法解決的，能夠做的要多做，多渡人，身體會更健康。&lt;br /&gt;
Cheer up and you’ll maintain your good health. There is no problem that cannot be solved. Try your best to do as many heavenly things as you can, and save as many people as you can, then you can be even healthier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   (仁波切：我執是不是一種貪心)我執不是一種貪心，那是對一種東西特別執著。(仁波切：是一種煩惱嗎？)是。因為執著那一種東西，所以有煩惱，但是也不要去執著沒有我，執著了也是一種煩惱，所以要讓它自然，自然就是美。&lt;br /&gt;
(A Tibetan monk asks: Is self-attachment an act of greed?) Self-attachment is not an act of greed, but it makes you cling too strong to something. (A Tibetan monk asks: Then is it an act that causes worry?) Yes, if you cling too strong to something, you start to worry. However, don’t force yourself to be “detached.” Simply let things go naturally and smoothly, and there lies true beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   你是人家師父，我是你師父，師父靠徒弟，徒弟靠師父，我保護你，你幫我，多去講經說法，讓眾生多瞭解，那你就功德無量。&lt;br /&gt;
Your students call you teacher, but remember I’m your Holy Teacher. Teacher and disciples help each other. Now Holy Teacher is helping you, then you can smoothly spread this wonderful message to your students. You merits are boundless then!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   今天你們上多久的課，聽得懂嗎？聽得懂要回答，不然我怎麼知道啊！如果你們聽不懂，我也就不用多講，有問要必答啊！在學校老師問話，你也要回答，在這裡也一樣，不管是任何人跟我們講話，都要有禮貌，人要有禮，有禮的人做事才有道理，所謂“有禮走遍天下，無禮寸步難行”所以禮很重要，而二個字：一個是禮貌，另一個是有道理的理。&lt;br /&gt;
As for today’s’ classes, how much do you understand? Answer loudly, or people will not understand you. It is the same at school when you teachers ask you questions, you should also answer loudly. Etiquette cannot be over emphasized. In Chinese language, the pronunciation of “li” carries two meanings: One is etiquette and good manners; the other means the right principles. That is why Chinese people have a proverb: “With li, one can travel the world; without li, one can’t even budge an inch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   你們喜不喜歡你們的朋友沒禮貌？你希望你的朋友對你有禮貌，你就必須先如此對待他，所以來佛堂，除了告訴你人生的道理，還告訴你做人的道理，告訴你要愛父母、要孝順，對朋友要有禮有義氣；對兄弟姊妹要互相尊重。&lt;br /&gt;
If your friends are impolite, will you like them? If you want your friends to be polite, you have to be polite first. Here in Temple, we not only gain you an insight into your life, but we teach the principles of life as well, how to love and honor your parents, being polite and trustful with friends, all the way to respecting your brothers and sisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   來這裡懂得東西很多，可以帶很多寶回去，這寶是看不到，要用心體會的，所以要專心聽，你分心就不瞭解了。難得是你坐了一天，就要有所收穫，這些道理不是在外面可以輕易學的，而是前面這些講師一點一滴的經驗，體悟出來才能告訴你們的，所以要珍惜。&lt;br /&gt;
You can learn a lot of things from here, it’s like you can dig out the wonderful treasure in a treasure mountain. The difference is that, the treasure here is invisible, and you need to stay calm to feel it. Concentration is crucial, because you won’t be able to feel it if you are distracted. This golden opportunity for you to sit here for one day makes you learn the hard-earned principles of life, all of which are experiences accumulated by these lecturers over a very long time. They are so precious that deserve your full attention. So you should cherish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   人生有什麼好珍惜的啊！人生有什麼是要珍惜的（班員：做好事、有禮貌、時間、仁慈…了解自我)，除了這些還有什麼是最重要的？(要能回天堂)容易嗎？（NO）只要你珍惜時間，了解自己人生，多做善事，你就是人間的菩薩，既然是人間的菩薩，那人間就是天堂，(YES)這證明大家在人間很幸福喔！所以懂得讓自己快樂、幸福的人，那你做人就成功。&lt;br /&gt;
But what is it in your life that you should really cherish? Anything? (Class reply: Do good deeds. Be polite. Cherish time. Mercy. Self-realization.) What is most important? (Class reply: Being able to go back to heaven.) Is it easy? (Class reply: No!) If you can realize the purpose of life, make the most of your time and do good deeds, you can be a living Bodhisattva. As a living Bodhisattva, you don’t need to travel all the way to heaven, because you are creating your heaven! (Class reply: Yes!) That means you are leading a joyful life. People who know how to live a joyful and blessed life are successful in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   因為你會把不好的轉為好的，所謂天堂、地獄就在一念之間。這班是為你們而開，人生不在富貴、金錢，人生最重要的是內德，有句話說“人窮志不窮”。“愛”，錢可以買得到嗎？愛可以給一般眾生，所以在這世上發揮你的愛，愛不分國界、不分眾生、不分種族，愛是發自內心對一種人的關懷，只要內心充滿愛，你可以得到世間更多更深的肯定，所以自己犧牲一點無所謂。&lt;br /&gt;
It is because you learn how to think differently by turning bad into good. In fact, we are not elevated to heaven or cast down into hell after we die; we transport ourselves there. This Tao Seminar is held exclusively for you, teaching you successful life is not in wealth or nobility, but rather in virtue and morality. People may not be wealthy financially, but they can be spiritually rich and abundant. Can you purchase “love” with money? Love is a kind of selfless devotion to all sentient beings. It transcends the differences in nationality, race and skin color. With love, people care for people. So spread your love to the whole world. If you always keep a loving heart, you can earn world’s recognitions. Your sacrifices will be rewarding then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   有句話說「你敬人一尺，人敬你一丈」還要把心打開，此兩個人是否真心交朋友，只要對方感受到你的真誠，你一定會感受到對方的愛，所以待人要很誠懇，也就是做人的道理，做人的道理有很多，有那幾部份：孝順父母，好行為，對任何人有好的態度，慈悲心、互相幫助、互相信任。&lt;br /&gt;
Well goes the proverb, “As you respect people a bit, so shall people respect you a lot.” Do it truthfully. If you respect your friends truthfully and sincerely, they’ll love you even more. So being truthful and respectful is one of the principles of life. What are the other principles? Love and honor your parents, do good deeds, keep a positive attitude towards everyone, have mercy, be helpful and trustworthy, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   今天是有些人第一次來，希望你們常回佛堂，你把你的朋友都帶來這裡，你們都是很虔誠的，是否很虔誠在拜佛啊！（YES）為什麼要拜佛？是為了什麼？佛在那裡！(在心裡)一直拜一直拜，是要迴光返照，學佛的腳步，每一個佛都是救渡眾生，都有一顆慈悲的心，每一個拜佛能夠去學習佛陀的精神，讓佛陀的精神在你們身上發揮出來，那拜佛才有意義，不要只是單單拜佛而不知道要怎麼去行出來，就太浪費了，太可惜了！&lt;br /&gt;
Today some of you come here for the first time. Hope you can come back more often. Also invite your friends to come along. You are all sincere and faithful in worshiping Buddhas, are you not? (Class reply: Yes!) Why do you worship Buddhas? For what purpose? Where are Buddhas? (Class reply: In mind.) When you worship Buddhas, it is like you are watching a mirror reflecting our own image. You should introspect yourself whether you’re doing what Buddhas do. In fact, every Buddha has a merciful heart; they are saving people all the time. So when worshiping Buddhas, you should really identify with Them and do what They do. This shall make the worship meaningful. If you just worship Buddhas without acting out the mercy, you’re wasting your time and effort. What a great pity! Hope you not only worship Buddhas sincerely and faithfully, but you can also act mercifully like a bodhisattva. Then your life will not be in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;◎   希望你們回去，除了真誠拜佛之外，要把菩薩的慈悲心嶄露出來，那你的人生才不會白活啊！希望大家常回來聽道理，這樣你的心才會越來越開，心量才會越來越廣，修道真的要有始有終。&lt;br /&gt;
Hope everybody can come back to Temple more often, to hear and to learn from different lecturers. By doing so, you broaden your horizon and learn to keep an open mind. Be sure to persist. In cultivating Tao, you must remain consistent from the start to the very end.&lt;/p&gt;
