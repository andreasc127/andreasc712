&lt;p&gt;活佛師尊慈悲囑語﹕&lt;br /&gt;
	你們那麼多人來做甚麼？來拜神！那你們拜甚麼神？甚麼神都拜那太貪心啦！拜神&lt;br /&gt;
   是為了甚麼？就是為了求平安？拜神！另外還有一個含意。除了求平安之外，還要&lt;br /&gt;
   幹嘛？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	「神」住在那裡啊？「神」住在你心裡！那你拜神不是拜你自己嘛？那你拜自己，&lt;br /&gt;
   求自己平安，對不對啊？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	你拜佛是為了效法仙佛的腳步啊！祂為甚麼會成為仙佛，又為甚麼會在供桌上讓你&lt;br /&gt;
   們謨拜？一定有祂的原因！那你們將來會不會跟祂們一樣？如果會的話就要看你們&lt;br /&gt;
   怎麼做。一個普通的人是不可能讓人家謨拜的。菩薩都是犧牲自己，為眾生奉獻、&lt;br /&gt;
   為國家來奉獻。為師問問你們，你們在這個社會為眾生做過甚麼呀？你們為國家做&lt;br /&gt;
   過甚麼呀？如果沒有，你的人生就太過沒有意義了！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	今天讓你來開法會，就是希望你們聽了課之後，能夠為眾生做些甚麼—要讓他們都&lt;br /&gt;
   得到神聖的這一點！不要小看這兩天的法會，要抱著非常真誠的心來。能夠在印度&lt;br /&gt;
   開這個法會確實是不容易！你們要有這個緣份坐在這裡，要感恩要珍惜，抱著最感&lt;br /&gt;
   恩的心來到這莊嚴的佛殿，不是來這裡喧鬧。當初國王要拜佛的時候，都必須持齋&lt;br /&gt;
   ，而且還要沐浴、還要更新衣，才可以禮拜仙佛；而今天大家那麼容易就能夠進到&lt;br /&gt;
   這裡，上天就會接受你們的禮拜。所以你們現在抱著甚麼心來？上天是非常慈悲的&lt;br /&gt;
   ，今天上天對你們慈悲，將來你們要對眾生付出更多的慈悲。所以你們想不想做仙&lt;br /&gt;
   佛？那你們想不想去幫助眾生啊？只要你有這一份心，願意去幫助眾生，那恭禧你&lt;br /&gt;
   ，你現在就是菩薩！所以以後拜佛，除了保平安之外，要跟著仙佛的腳步去走。仙&lt;br /&gt;
   佛的腳步可不是走的很容易哦！因為由古至今，所有的仙佛都要經過歷煉，那是上&lt;br /&gt;
   天對他的考驗，考驗他是不是真心的；如果你們不是真心就會被考倒。如果你們確&lt;br /&gt;
   實是真心，那就一定會成功啊！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	形相不重要，最主要是心不變。你們拜佛就是要學習那個心，所以圖片不重要。我&lt;br /&gt;
   為甚麼會成為你們的老師？為甚麼不是其他的仙佛成為你們老師？你們知不知道原&lt;br /&gt;
   因？拜師要知道為甚麼拜祂為師，不可隨意亂拜師啊！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	來到這裡沒有看到為師也要高興，因為你抱著拜佛的心裡來，就要心存高興。一個&lt;br /&gt;
   人的心中會高興，就是表示他法喜充滿。一個人的心中高興也表示他心裡沒有苦、&lt;br /&gt;
   沒有怨恨。你心中高興，你就會帶給周遭的人也一樣高興，修道辦道也是如此。即&lt;br /&gt;
   然來到這裡就即來之則安之，好好專心來聽課。你這兩天聽的課是外面聽不到的，&lt;br /&gt;
   所以要把握這個機會。法會只能開一次，下一次再來可不是坐在這兒，而是要在後&lt;br /&gt;
   面、在旁邊去服務人家。想不想下一次法會的時候去服務大家呀？今天你受了人家&lt;br /&gt;
   的恩惠，下一次你就要去回報給別人，他們這一些前面的前賢（新加坡的辦事人員）&lt;br /&gt;
   出錢出力還花精神，就是希望能幫助你們、希望你們也得到上天的佛光普照。那你&lt;br /&gt;
   們覺得他們偉不偉大？所以你們要感謝他們！他們為甚麼不去別地方要來你們這裡&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	一個人要常保正氣，一個修道人要有一股正氣，才不會有邪氣侵入，要控制自己的&lt;br /&gt;
   意念。如果你的心不夠靜，就會有不好的東西來接近你，因為你所存的氣不是正氣&lt;br /&gt;
   。所以一個人的心中要常常發出一股善氣，唯有一股善氣才能夠抵得過邪氣。如果&lt;br /&gt;
   你們每一個人都保持著善氣的話，那不好的氣就不敢來接近我們。接近我們的就會&lt;br /&gt;
   是仙佛的善氣，所以徒兒們啊！那你們現在知不知道要怎麼樣去守住你們那一顆心&lt;br /&gt;
   了嗎？所以以後你們常常保持那股善氣，仙佛就會在你們的周遭。知道就要去做，&lt;br /&gt;
   叫著知行要合一。&lt;br /&gt;
	上了兩天的課，就要知道怎麼去幫助別人，要讓你們的同胞，大家都能夠心連心，&lt;br /&gt;
   這樣你們的國家才會和平、才會安樂。大家都是同修，不要分彼此，以後任何一個&lt;br /&gt;
   人只要有困難，我們都要伸出援手去幫助他們，所謂助人為快樂之本。當你做一件&lt;br /&gt;
   好事的時候，你快不快樂？以後希望你們多幫助別人，因為只要做一件好事，你就&lt;br /&gt;
   會心裡充滿了法喜。你喜歡你的心一直是快樂還是痛苦的？只要你快樂，你周遭的&lt;br /&gt;
   人也會快樂。我們不要覺得自己很苦，上天讓我們來到這個地方，一定有我們的使&lt;br /&gt;
   命在。上天需要你們來幫助渡化更多的眾生回去，你們願不願意擔起這個責任啊？&lt;br /&gt;
   那以後這裡就看你們了！修道幫助別人可不是一天兩天的事，而是要你的一輩子去&lt;br /&gt;
   投入、去奉獻。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	拿了糖果要拿給你的好朋友吃，你不是要幫助別人嗎？你吃了，平安也要讓你的朋&lt;br /&gt;
   友平安，你要告訴他們這糖果是哪裡來的，這糖果是誰給的，下一次記得把他們也&lt;br /&gt;
   帶來，懂不懂？不要吃了我的糖，以後不見人影！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	為師送你們「使命」， 就是希望你們每一個人，都要有使命感，都要有一份責任在&lt;br /&gt;
   身。人不要看輕自己，來到人世間就有一份不簡單的使命在身。將來你的使命沒有&lt;br /&gt;
   完成，你就不能夠回天；所以希望你們都看重自己，提起那一份責任，可不要對你&lt;br /&gt;
   的人生輕視、對你的人生來馬馬虎虎、迷迷糊糊的過。這兩天法會，就是希望你們&lt;br /&gt;
   能夠看清你自己的人生。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	不要為師走了之後，你們就忘記，要把訓文時時刻刻放在心中，也要把為師常常放&lt;br /&gt;
   在心中，往後就看你們自己怎麼走，能不能夠成功就靠你自己，你們要好好保重、&lt;br /&gt;
   好好照顧自己，才可以去幫助別人。咱們後會有期，祝你們成功啊！&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TRANSLATION OF POEM&lt;br /&gt;

8.	Bravery and courageous in shouldering the mission, there will be a day when one’s name will be honoured by many for generations after generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am,&lt;br /&gt;
JiGong the Living Buddha&lt;br /&gt;
Having received the Heavenly Decree&lt;br /&gt;
To come to the mortal world&lt;br /&gt;
Already paid respect to the&lt;br /&gt;
Heavenly Mother&lt;br /&gt;
Asking all my disciples, are you all happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TRANSLATION OF MAIN ORACLE&lt;br /&gt;
(Mercifulness of Enlightened Master JiGong)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.	Travelled a thousand miles in search of an enlightened path; once enlightened, one will realize one’s true origin.&lt;br /&gt;
2.	Grab hold of one’s destiny; true cultivators must put in effort.&lt;br /&gt;
3.	Being a messenger, one must assist Heaven in the propagation; living in accordance to the Five Human Relations and the Eight Virtues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;
Five Human Relations:&lt;br /&gt;
1)	righteousness between superiors and subordinates&lt;br /&gt;
2)	closeness between parents and children&lt;br /&gt;
3)	dedicated duties between husband and wife&lt;br /&gt;
4)	orderliness between siblings&lt;br /&gt;
5)	trustworthiness between friends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight virtues:&lt;br /&gt;
1)	Filial Piety&lt;br /&gt;
2)	Brotherhood&lt;br /&gt;
3)	Loyalty&lt;br /&gt;
4)	Trustworthiness&lt;br /&gt;
5)	Etiquette&lt;br /&gt;
6)	Sense of honour&lt;br /&gt;
7)	Sense of shame&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.	Take up one’s heavenly duty with faith; set aims and strive forward.&lt;br /&gt;
5.	Truly believe and have strong faith in Tao; one must learn to endure humiliation in order to carry out the heavenly tasks.&lt;br /&gt;
6.	Inherit the missions of past saints and pass on this torch; exercise one’s wisdom and not withholding a second thought.&lt;br /&gt;
7.	It is indeed a great responsibility to shoulder; all in the good course of giving joy and alleviating the sufferings of others.&lt;br /&gt;
8.	Buoy up one’s spirit; utmost sincerity in carrying out the heavenly tasks without resentment or anger.&lt;br /&gt;
9.	There is no stopping in establishing the sacred works of past saints; the duty of helping the people who are not enlightened lies in each and every one of you.&lt;br /&gt;
10.	Hope that each and every one of you would take up this responsibility; continue the saga and cultivate one’s upright character and morals.&lt;br /&gt;
11.	It is hoped that those who are in hardship and distress could be lead into the moral and righteous path.&lt;br /&gt;
12.	Cultivate and act in accordance to one’s true nature; exercise firmness and flexibility and exhibit true behaviour.&lt;br /&gt;
13.	Regard this duty as important and not belittle nor act lightly on it; cultivate one’s moral character highly and those around you would naturally come near you.&lt;br /&gt;
14.	Heaven regards highly one’s role and so one must be cautious in one’s way of life; withhold an upright character and display moral integrity.&lt;br /&gt;
15.	Carry out one’s heavenly duty to one’s utmost ability while maintaining serenity and calmness within oneself in a world of temptations; this is the process of cultivating one’s virtues.&lt;br /&gt;
16.	It is one’s heavenly duty to awaken those who are still lost in the sentient world; harmony is to prevail again in the sentient world.&lt;br /&gt;
17.	There is no other way to cultivate oneself and be morally upright; a glass ball may be covered with layers of dust but deep within, it is pure and clear, likewise to one’s true self.&lt;br /&gt;
18.	Once this is understood, one would be able to seek enlightenment and save not just oneself but also others.&lt;br /&gt;
19.	Steadfast in one’s duty to correct any wrong doings; make vigorous effort to turn the tide (bad practices).&lt;br /&gt;
20.	Carry out one’s heavenly duty diligently to lead others in performing upright behaviours; bring peace and universal harmony to the world.&lt;br /&gt;
21.	Exhibit one’s original pureness and conscience; a pure nature is as clear as a crystal without any worldly desires.&lt;br /&gt;
22.	Gradually researching and understanding more each day; one would understand all other principles once the true origin is realized.&lt;br /&gt;
23.	When carrying out the heavenly duty, one cannot anticipate how much effort to put in; but rather to take up the mission from the beginning till the end.&lt;br /&gt;
24.	Once transcending the cycle of life and death; one is considered enlightened and attained Buddhahood in this mortal world.&lt;br /&gt;
25.	Before accomplishing the heavenly duty assigned, one would have to pass through the tests bestowed upon you.&lt;br /&gt;
26.	The tests by heaven are to examine one’s determination and to select those who are morally good.&lt;br /&gt;
27.	Withhold the Tao in you and act accordingly; cultivate inner virtues and establish external merits.&lt;br /&gt;
28.	Display humbleness in any dealings; sincerity is the only way to show one’s conduct to heaven.&lt;br /&gt;
29.	If one tries one’s very best, one will surely succeed and gain title of nobility.&lt;br /&gt;
30.	One’s true self is in completeness and when one is able to realize this principle, all other principles in this world will be unfolded.&lt;br /&gt;
31.	One’s virtues will make one stand out among the crowd; it is the same virtue that will enable the world to live in harmony.&lt;br /&gt;
32.	Be courageous and shoulder the mission; only then will one’s name be passed down generations after generations, just like the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TRANSLATION OF ORACLE WITHIN ORACLE (MISSION)&lt;br /&gt;
(Mercifulness of Enlightened Master JiGong)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take on this mission of yours, a sacred task being highly looked upon. Carry out one’s duty diligently with commitment, effort and willingness to offer. With full of courage and confidence, together with a firm and indomitable drive, and with utmost sincerity, one is able to fulfill the mission. Continuing the mission from the past saints and preserved the continuity, it is indeed a heavy responsibility to shoulder. Do not act rashly, strive to cultivate one’s character and morals, be virtuous, benevolent and righteous in one’s actions. Even to the extent of helping others to be upright, lead the lost to be enlightened, redeem the society from decadent practices and let everyone return to his/her pure good nature. Let peace prevails in this world. Before the mission is considered accomplished, it has to go through the test of time but an undaunted mind and sincerity in carrying out the mission will see to the mission’s success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercifulness of Enlightened Master JiGong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	There are so many of you and what is your purpose of coming here? To worship god! Which god do you worship? Isn’t it too greedy to worship whatever god that you come across? What is the purpose of worshipping god? Only for self peace? Besides self peace, there is another meaning in worshipping god, do you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Where does “God” reside in? “God” resides in you! Since “God” resides in you, are you not worshipping yourself when you worship “God”? Do you think it is correct to worship yourself and ask for self peace?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	The reason behind worshipping buddha is to follow the examples of buddhas.  How is it that this statue can be a buddha and be placed at the altar for all of you to worship? There must be a reason to it. So, will all of you be like the buddhas in future? If your answer is positive, the rest is up to you. A normal person can never be worshipped by others. All buddhas sacrifice themselves for the benefits of all sentient beings and the country. Let me ask you a question, have you done anything in this society to benefit others? Have you done anything to benefit the country? If you have not, then your life will be meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Today you are able to attend the Sermon Assembly. It is hoped that after you have listened to the topics delivered, you are able to do something for others. That is to enable them to be initiated and received this Holy Tao! Do not look down on these two days’ Sermon Assembly but rather to come with utmost sincerity. It is indeed not easy to attend Sermon Assembly in India! It is your destiny to be able to sit here. One must be grateful and treasure it; one must come to this solemn hall with the most grateful heart and not to create noise and excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	In the past, whenever the King would like to pay his respect to the buddhas, the King would practice vegetarianism, have a bathe and changed into clean clothing before praying to the buddhas. While today, all of you can come here so easily to be blessed by the Heaven. So, what are your intentions in coming?&lt;br /&gt;
	Heaven has bestowed benevolence to you; likewise, you would need to bestow even more kindness to others in future. So, do you wish to be a buddha one day? Do you wish to help others who are in need? As long as you have this mindset in helping others, then I shall congratulate you because you are now a buddha! The next time you worship to buddhas, besides praying for self peace, your should aim to follow the examples of buddhas. However, it is not easy to follow the foot steps of buddhas. Since time immemorial, all buddhas must go through tests after tests given by the Heaven. To test whether you are truly sincere. You would not pass the test if you are not truly sincere. If you are truly sincere, then you will surely succeed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Outward appearance is not important. The most important is to withhold this faith. Likewise, it is this faith you need to learn when worshipping buddhas, the pictures are not important. Why am I your Enlightening Master? Why not other buddhas? Do you know why? There is a need to know why we acknowledge someone as our Master and not anyone as we please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	You should feel happy even if I do not descend down to meet you. That is because you have come to worship buddhas with a merry heart. A person who is happy is filled with divine joy; a person who is happy has no sufferings and hatred. When you feel happy, you can also bring happiness to others around you; likewise for cultivation and propagation of Tao. Since you are here, you may as well stay and make the best out of it by listening to the topics delivered. Seize the opportunity as you are not able to listen to such topics in outside seminars. Everyone can only attend the Sermon Assembly once. The next time you come, you will not be sitting here but behind or by the sides to offer your services to others. Do you wish to offer your services to others in the next Sermon Assembly? Today, you have received kindness from others and should repay back to others the next time. These seniors in front of you (volunteers from Singapore) have come out with their own money, effort and energy in hoping to help all of you to receive the divine light by heaven. Do you think they are great? So you need to thank them. Why don’t they go to other places instead of coming here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	A person must always withhold a righteous aura in him; a Tao cultivator must have this righteous aura, so that evil force will not invade you. It is important to have self-control in your thoughts. If you cannot calm your mind, the bad things will get close to you because the aura in you is not the righteous aura. That is why a person must always exhibit an aura of kindness, only then will a person be able to ward off evil force. If each and every one of you is able to preserve this aura of kindness in you, then the bad force will not get close to you. What is close to us will only be the buddhas aura of kindness. So, all my disciples, do you now know how to exhibit self-control over your mind? In future, if you are able to always preserve this aura of kindness, buddhas will be around you. Know it and do it, this is called “knowing and doing as one”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	After listening to the topics delivered during these two days, you must know how to help others and enable our fellow countryman to be united. Only then will there be peace and harmony in the country. All of you are fellow cultivators, do not isolate one another. If there is a person who is in difficulty and needs help, all of us should extend our helping hands to assist him/her, as there is happiness in helping others. Do you feel happy in doing a good deed? Hope that all of you would help more people in future because as long as one good deed is performed, you will be filled with joy. Do you like to be in a joyful state or in a suffering state of mind? As long as you feel happy, others around you could also feel the same. Do not feel that you are in a suffering state. Since you are destined to be born here, there must be a mission for you to accomplish. Heaven needs all of you to help and save more sentient beings back to heaven. Are you willing to shoulder this responsibility? (Yes) Then the future of Madurai lies in your hands. Cultivation of Tao and helping others is not a one or two day’s affairs but a life-long participation and service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	After you have taken the sweets, share it with your good friends. Didn’t you say you want to help others? If you are blessed by eating the sweets, you should let your friends be blessed as well. You should tell them where the sweets come from and who gave it to you. Remember to bring them here the next time, do you understand? Do not disappear after taking my sweets and not come the next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	The oracle I am giving to you is “MISSION”. It is hoped that every one of you will take up this mission and responsibility in you. Do not belittle yourself as everyone borne in this world has been tasked an unsurpassed mission. A person would not be able to return to heaven if the mission is not accomplished. So, look highly upon yourself and take up the responsibility. Do not despise your life and live carelessly or in a dazed. It is hoped that after the two days Sermon Assembly, all of you are able to recognize you own meaningful life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Do not forget what I said after I left. Always remember to keep the oracle in your heart; always to keep me in your heart. The future depends on how you do and success or not also depends on your own effort. Take good care of yourself, only then will you be able to help others. We shall meet again and wish all of you success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
